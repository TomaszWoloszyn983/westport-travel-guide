# Westport Travel Guide Webpage.

## Welcome to my page! 

![Title image](assets/images/readMe/amIResponive_black_background.jpg)


This page was created to provide a bunch of information about the town of Westport located in County Mayo at the west coast of Ireland in short and easy way.
The page provides a brief and useful set of information such as location, population, contact, brief history of the town and a gallery of photos.




## Feature
The page includes five sections devided into three subpages:
It is as follows:
- **Home Page** that contain some general informations about the town. This section also contains two other subsections:
    * **Events** section presents list of events taking place in the town in the nearest future and it is suppose to be updated as often as it's possible.

    * **Contact** section and the map with pointed the locations of Westport. It also contains the address of the Town Hall, contact phone number and email address.
    The user also can post a question to the towns information center. This section needs some updates, such as applying a specific address for posting the massage to. Temporarily an attempt to send a message effects being redirected back to the Home Page. 

      Clicking the Send button will result with being redirected to the home page as you can se on the pictures below:
